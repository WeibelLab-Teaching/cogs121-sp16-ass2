Scenario:
Patrolling San Diego.  Design a tool to help law enforcement officers efficiently patrol areas that unsafe.  Our specific aspect of the problem regards preventing motor vehicle accidents.

About:
Our California Highway Patrol officers work hard to assure the safe, convenient and efficient transportation of people and goods on our highway system.  With a massively expansive highway system and a limited amount of resources, CHP officers are faced with the problem of how they can position themselves in the most strategic places to prevent and respond to motor vehicle collisions.  This is where Crash Vis comes in.  Our application is capable of visualizing real-time statistics on motor vehicle collisions in a way that can be easily interpreted by officers to help them identify problem areas on the road.  The easier it is for our officers to see the problem, the easier it is for them to control traffic and prevent collisions.
